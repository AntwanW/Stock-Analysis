## Overview of Project

### Purpose and background are well defined (2 pt).
Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

	The purpose of this analysis was to edit or refactor previous code in Excel VBA to compile stock information for the years 2017 and 2018 to determine if the stock is worth investing. The challenge was to increase the efficiency of the original code and determine if it was successful. Then explain my findings. 

###Results

	The goal is to retrieve the ticker, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock from two data charts of stock information. The stock information incorporate a ticker value, the date the stock was issued, the opening and closing, the highest and lowest price, adjusted closing price, and the volume of the stock. The information provided was an outline of steps to help refactor the original code. The steps were then listed out to set the structure for the refactoring. The screenshots of the code is listed below.

###Summary

####What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

* The advantage of refactoring is that the code is less complex, organized, and easier to understand and read. It could helps with debugging and faster programming. The disadvantage is that you might have to retest lots of functions and it is time consuming.

####How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

* The advantage is that refactoring could have better quality. The disadvantage is not knowing where to go next after changing a line, and trying to debug. Unsure if refactoring actually help with run time or if your coding is correct.
